 The complaint alleges that these letters "contained false, slanderous, libelous, inflammatory and derogatory statements" concerning respondent. App. 4-5.

 The First Amendment guarantees "the right of the people . . . to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."  The right to petition is cut from the same cloth as the other guarantees of that Amendment, and is an assurance of a particular freedom of expression.  In
 <i>
  United States v. Cruikshank,
 </i>

 The historical roots of the Petition Clause long antedate the Constitution.  In 1689, the Bill of Rights exacted of William and Mary stated:  "[I]t is the Right of the Subjects to petition the King."  1 Wm. &amp; Mary, Sess. 2, ch. 2.  This idea reappeared in the Colonies when the Stamp Act Congress of 1765 included a right to petition the King and Parliament in its Declaration of Rights and Grievances.  See 1 B. Schwartz, The Bill of Rights—A Documentary History 198 (1971).  And the Declarations of Rights enacted by many state conventions contained a right to petition for redress of grievances.  See,
 <i>
  e.g.,
 </i>
 Pennsylvania Declaration of Rights (1776).
</p>
<p class="indent">
 Although the values in the right of petition as an important aspect of self-government are beyond question, it does not follow that the Framers of the First Amendment believed that the Petition Clause provided absolute immunity from damages for libel.  Early libel cases in state courts provide no clear evidence of the nature of the right to petition as it existed at the time the First Amendment was adopted;  these cases reveal conflicting views of the privilege afforded expressions in petitions to government officials.

 The plaintiff in the Vermont case of

The court, based on its understanding of "the right of petitioning the supreme power," granted the defendant's request for an "absolute and unqualified immunity from all responsibility."

 <i>

 at 291.  Nothing presented to us suggests that the Court's decision not to recognize an absolute privilege in 1845 should be altered; we are not prepared to conclude, 140 years later, that the Framers of the First Amendment understood the right to petition to include an unqualified right to express damaging falsehoods in exercise of that right.

 Nor do the Court's decisions interpreting the Petition Clause in contexts other than defamation indicate that the right to petition is absolute.

 To accept petitioner's claim of absolute immunity would elevate the Petition Clause to special First Amendment status. The Petition Clause, however, was inspired by the same ideals of liberty and democracy that gave us the freedoms to speak, publish, and assemble.  See

 The petitioner Robert McDonald contends that when a citizen communicates directly with Government officials about matters of public importance—here the qualifications of a candidate for United States Attorney—the First Amendment's Petition Clause requires courts in defamation actions to accord an
 <i>
  absolute
 </i>
 privilege to such communications rather than the qualified privilege defined in
 <i>
  New York Times.
 </i>
 I fully agree with the Court that the Petition Clause imposes no such absolute privilege.
</p>
<p class="indent">
 McDonald correctly notes that the right to petition the Government requires stringent protection.  "The very idea of a government, republican in form, implies a right on the part of its citizens to meet peaceably for consultation in respect to public affairs and to petition for a redress of grievances."
 <i>
  United States v. Cruikshank,
 </i>
 2 Otto 542, 92 U.S. 542, 552, 23 L.Ed. 588 (1876).  The right to petition is "among the most precious of the liberties guaranteed by the Bill of Rights,"
 <i>
  Mine Workers v. Illinois Bar Assn.,
 </i>
 389 U.S. 217, 222, 88 S.Ct. 353, 356, 19 L.Ed.2d 426 (1967), and except in the most extreme circumstances citizens cannot be punished for exercising this right "without violating those fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all civil and political institutions,"
 <i>
  De Jonge v. Oregon,
 </i>
 299 U.S. 353, 364, 57 S.Ct. 255, 260, 81 L.Ed. 278 (1937).  As with the freedoms of speech and press, exercise of the right to petition "may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials," and the occasionally "erroneous statement is inevitable."
 <i>
  New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, supra,
 </i>
 376 U.S., at 270-271, 84 S.Ct., at 720-721.  The First Amendment requires that we extend substantial " 'breathing space' " to such expression, because a rule imposing liability whenever a statement was accidently or negligently incorrect would intolerably chill "would-be critics of official conduct . . . from voicing their criticism."  376 U.S., at 272, 279, 84 S.Ct., at 721, 725.

 We have not interpreted the First Amendment, however, as requiring protection of
 <i>
  all
 </i>
 statements concerning public officials.
</p>
<p class="indent">
 "Although honest utterance, even if inaccurate, may further      the fruitful exercise of the right of free speech, it does      not follow that the lie, knowingly and deliberately published      about a public official, should enjoy a like immunity.  At      the time the First Amendment was adopted, as today, there      were those unscrupulous enough and skillful enough to use the      deliberate or reckless falsehood as an effective political      tool to unseat the public servant or even to topple an      administration. . . .  That speech is used as a tool for      political ends does not automatically bring it under the      protective mantle of the Constitution.  For the use of the      known lie as a tool is at once at odds with the premises of      democratic government and with the orderly manner in which      economic, social, or political change is to be effected.      Calculated falsehood falls into that class of utterances      which 'are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and      are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any      benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed      by the social interest in order and morality. . . .'

 </i>
 315 U.S. 568, 572, 62 S.Ct.      766, 769, 86 L.Ed. 1031.  Hence the knowingly false statement      and the false statement made with reckless disregard of the      truth, do not enjoy constitutional protection."

 McDonald argues that, for two reasons, this qualification of the right vigorously to criticize public officials should not apply to expression falling within the scope of the Petition Clause.
 <a class="footnote" href="#fn2-1" id="fn2-1_ref">
  2
 </a>
 First, he contends that petitioning historically was accorded an absolute immunity and that the Framers included the Petition Clause in the First Amendment on this understanding.  I agree with the Court that the evidence concerning 17th- and 18th-century British and colonial practice reveals, at most, "conflicting views of the privilege afforded expressions in petitions to government officials,"
 <i>
  ante,
 </i>
 at 483, and does not persuasively demonstrate the Framers' intent to accord absolute immunity to petitioning.
</p>
<p class="indent">
 Second, McDonald argues that criticism of public officials under the Petition Clause is functionally different from, and therefore entitled to greater protection than, criticism of officials falling within the protection of the First Amendment's Speech and Press Clauses.  Specifically, he contends that "
 <i>
  [u]nlike the more general freedoms of speech and press,
 </i>
 the right to petition was understood by the Framers of the Constitution and the First Amendment to be a necessary right of a self-governing people," and that "when the citizen is not speaking to the public at large, but is directly exercising his right to petition, [he] is thus performing a self-governmental function."  Brief for Petitioner 7, 30 (emphasis added).  Such a distinction is untenable.  The Speech and Press Clauses, every bit as much as the Petition Clause, were included in the First Amendment to ensure the growth and preservation of democratic self-governance.  A citizen who criticizes a public official is shielded by the Speech and Press Clauses because "[i]t is as much his
 <i>
  duty
 </i>
 to criticize as it is the official's duty to administer."
 <i>
  New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,
 </i>
 376 U.S., at 282, 84 S.Ct., at 727 (emphasis added).  "[S]peech concerning public affairs is more than self-expression;  it is the essence of self-government."

 The Framers envisioned the rights of speech, press, assembly, and petitioning as interrelated components of the public's exercise of its sovereign authority.  As Representative James Madison observed during the House of Representatives' consideration of the First Amendment:
</p>
<p class="indent">
 "The right of freedom of speech is secured;  the liberty of      the press is expressly declared to be beyond the reach of      this Government;  the people may therefore publicly address      their representatives, may privately advise them, or declare      their sentiments by petition to the whole body;
 <i>
  in all these      ways they may communicate their will.
 </i>
 "  1 Annals of Cong. 738      (1789) (emphasis added).
</p>
<p class="indent">
 The Court previously has emphasized the essential unity of the First Amendment's guarantees:
</p>
<p class="indent">
 "It was not by accident or coincidence that the rights to      freedom in speech and press were coupled in a single guaranty with the rights of the people peaceably to assemble      and to petition for redress of grievances.  All these, though      not identical, are inseparable.  They are cognate rights, . .      . and therefore are united in the First Article's assurance."

</p>
<p class="indent">
 And although we have not previously addressed the precise issue before us today, we have recurrently treated the right to petition similarly to, and frequently as overlapping with, the First Amendment's other guarantees of free expression.  See,

 There is no persuasive reason for according greater or lesser protection to expression on matters of public importance depending on whether the expression consists of speaking to neighbors across the backyard fence, publishing an editorial in the local newspaper, or sending a letter to the President of the United States.  It necessarily follows that expression falling within the scope of the Petition Clause, while fully protected by the actual-malice standard set forth in

  For purposes of applying an absolute immunity in the Petition Clause context, McDonald suggests that we need consider only those expressions that "touc[h] on" and are "relevant to" the official conduct of public servants, and that are "contained in a private petition to federal officials who [have] authority to take responsive actions."  Brief for Petitioner 7, and n. 7.  The Court long ago concluded, however, that the Petition Clause embraces a much broader range of communications addressed to the executive, the legislature, courts, and administrative agencies.  See,
  <i>
   e.g., Bill Johnson's Restaurants, Inc. v. NLRB,
